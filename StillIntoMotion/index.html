A digital figure responds to environmental sound, caught in a perpetual dance that never concludes. The work explores the transition from physical to virtual, 
  linking bodily motion with sound in a continuous feedback loop—stillness within movement, movement emerging from stillness. 
  It becomes an interlude in the exhibition space, where rhythm is shaped by presence and absence, gesture and sound.
