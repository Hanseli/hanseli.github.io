Hollow porcelain stones invite engagement through listening and touch. 
Visitors can manipulate a microphone to capture resonances from both the interior and exterior spaces of the stones, experiencing shifts in sound that mirror the transition from enclosed depth to openness. 
Another interaction encourages visitors to engage through touch—rubbing and pressing against the textured surfaces to generate variations in sound, uncovering the hushed tones embedded within the material.
